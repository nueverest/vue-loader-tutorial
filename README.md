Checking out vue-loader

# Setup

**Run these commands**
npm init
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server vue-loader vue-html-loader css-loader vue-style-loader vue-hot-reload-api babel-loader babel-core babel-plugin-transform-runtime babel-preset-es2015 babel-runtime --save-dev

*If it says that something was not installed, then open `package.json` and set the version equal to the version 
that was not installed.*

For Example:
```
npm WARN vue-loader@8.5.2 requires a peer of vue-hot-reload-api@^1.2.0 but none was installed.
Open package.json and edit this line: "vue-hot-reload-api": "^1.2.0",
Now run: npm install
```

**Next run**
npm install vue --save
